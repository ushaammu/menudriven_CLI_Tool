# menudriven_CLI_Tool
This Python program is a simple menu-driven network utility tool designed to help users perform two key networking tasks: testing IP reachability using ping and generating summary statistics from latency values. The tool runs continuously until the user selects the exit option, making it interactive and easy to use.
The program is divided into three main sections. The first section handles IP reachability testing. It defines a function called test_ip_reachability(), which takes a list of IP addresses and pings each one using the system’s ping command. The subprocess.run() function executes the ping command and checks the return code. If the return code is zero, it prints that the IP address is reachable; otherwise, it prints that it is unreachable. This helps users quickly verify network connectivity with multiple devices or servers.
The second section focuses on latency summary calculations. It includes two functions: calculate_average() and get_summary(). The first function simply computes the average value from a list of numbers by dividing their sum by the total count. The get_summary() function generates a dictionary containing the minimum, maximum, and average latency values. This feature is useful for analyzing network performance and understanding response time variations.
The final section is the menu system, implemented inside the menu() function. It repeatedly displays a menu with three choices: IP testing, latency summary, and exit. Based on the user’s selection, it collects the required input. For option 1, the user enters comma-separated IPs, which the program converts into a list. For option 2, the user enters latency values, which are converted to integers before processing. Option 3 terminates the program gracefully. Any invalid choice results in an error message and the menu reappears.
Overall, this program demonstrates practical usage of functions, loops, input handling, dictionaries, and system commands. It offers a simple but effective way to perform basic network diagnostics through Python.
